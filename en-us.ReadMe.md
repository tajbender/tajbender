# Cover Letter – Raw Fury (Freelance Support)

Hello Raw Fury,

I’m Thorsten — a former enterprise developer who now builds small creative tech projects, tools, translations, and experiments simply because I enjoy it. I’m not looking for a job. I’m looking to support Raw Fury in the ways I naturally operate anyway.

I’d love to help you in exactly the areas where I already live:

- translation & text polishing (DE/EN)
- small tools & scripts
- debugging, testing, edge‑case hunting
- feedback, style guidance, UX notes
- creative technical problem‑solving
- nerd energy pointed in the right direction

I’m not offering “work”.  
I’m offering **curiosity, experience, and genuine enthusiasm**.

In a previous life, I developed large‑scale systems for OTTO Group, BAUR, SportScheck, and Witt — big systems, big responsibility, big meetings. That was then. Today I work independently, freely, playfully, and with a focus on things that help people and spark joy.

Why Raw Fury?

Because your games, your tone, and your philosophy resonate with me.  
Because personality, humor, and attention to detail matter to you.  
Because I already spend my free time building, testing, or translating things that fit your world — just without an official label.

If you need someone to translate, polish, break, fix, question, or creatively reinterpret something: I’m here.  
If you need someone to sit in meetings: I’m not.

_*Best regards,*_  Thorsten Jung
