# Cover Letter – Raw Fury (If Raw Fury Were a Metal Band 🤘🔥)

Dear Raw Fury,

If Raw Fury were a metal band, I’d be the guy who shows up backstage with a soldering iron, a bag of weird adapters, a half‑finished translation, and a tool that nobody asked for but everyone suddenly needs 😈

I’m Thorsten — former enterprise developer, now full‑time creative tech gremlin.  
I don’t apply for jobs. I join **bands**.

Here’s what I bring to the stage:

- translating & rewriting like a lyrical exorcist (DE/EN) 🎤  
- tiny tools & scripts that behave like pedalboard effects 🛠️  
- debugging & edge‑case hunting with blast‑beat precision ⚡  
- feedback that hits like a well‑timed breakdown 💥  
- creative problem‑solving that bends genres 🤘  
- pure nerd energy, distortion‑level enthusiasm 🔥

I’m not offering “work”.  
I’m offering **volume**, **curiosity**, and **technical riffage**.

In my previous life, I built large systems for OTTO Group, BAUR, SportScheck, and Witt — the corporate equivalent of playing in a symphonic metal band with a strict conductor and too many spreadsheets.  
I left that stage.  
Now I play the music I want.

## Why Raw Fury? 🎸💛

Because your tone already sounds like a band that refuses to tune down its personality.  
Because your games feel like concept albums with soul.  
Because your philosophy hits the same frequency as my creative chaos.

I already spend my free time building, testing, translating, and poking at things that fit your vibe — just without the backstage pass.

If you need someone to translate, polish, break, fix, question, or creatively reinterpret something: I’m ready to plug in 😌  
If you need someone to sit in meetings: that’s not metal, and neither am I 😄

Stay loud,  
**Thorsten Jung**
